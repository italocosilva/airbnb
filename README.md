## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

It was used Python 3 from Anaconda distribution.

Libraries needed:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used the Boston Airbnb dataset from Kaggle.

This dataset describes the Boston, MA listing activity of homestays. It also includes a calendar of the next one year of available houses for rent (from september 2016 to september 2017).

Using this dataset I was looking for answers to these questions:

1. What is the average price per neighbourhood?
2. What is the busiest epoch of the year?
3. Can we predict house's price based on prior data?

You can find the full dataset and files directly from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main file is a Jupyter Notebook: airbnb-boston.ipynb. Here you can find all the code and analysis I had run and results I have colected.

Furthermore you will find some other files that includes: Airbnb logo, data-wrangling (Excel file used to filter columns used for my model) and README (this file).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!
